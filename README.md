Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Who am I?

As a curious undergraduate with a passion for tech, I delve into both programming languages and cutting-edge devices, loving to share knowledge with the rest of the world. Since I'm (still) an undergraduate, I actively contribute my code to the open-source community, hoping it empowers others.
